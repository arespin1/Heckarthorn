Implements Collective action and group heterogeneity: Voluntary provision versus selective incentives, by Douglas D. Heckathorn, 1993.

## Objective

Examine the links between group heterogeneity and collective action under three regimes:
1.	Voluntary cooperation systems: Actors make autonomous decisions regarding participation in collective action
2.	Compliance systems: Actors create and enforce compliance norms that compel others to participate in the production of public goods
3.	Balanced systems: In which actors can impose compliance norms, but can also oppose such norms through “oppositional control” 

Consider all three types of heterogeneity examined in previous studies:
1.	Interests
2.	Costs
3.	Resources

Examine a broad array of production functions
